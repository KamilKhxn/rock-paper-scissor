# Rock Paper Scissors 

Rock Paper Scisors is my first app. Check out a live demo [here](https://kamilkhxn.github.io/rock-paper-scissor/)

## About


A combination of **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** were used to track the user's and computer's score and print a update message each round. 

Some key things I learned about:
* **DOM manipulation** - changed scores and message with the .innerHTML property
* **Event Handlers** - checked which buttons were pressed, using the event 'click'
* **Changing CSS elements using JavsScript** - changed the border of the users selection based on the round's outcome (win, lose, draw) by adding a class then removing it after a some time (setTimeout)
