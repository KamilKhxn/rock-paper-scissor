Rock Paper Scisors is my first app, hosted on GitHub pages, at xxx

## About


A combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS were used to track the user's and computer's score and print a update message each round. 

Some key things I learned about:
* DOM manipulation - changed scores and message
* Handling events - checked which button was pressed using event handlers 
* Changing CSS elements using JavsScript - changed border of option selected based round's outcome (win, lose, draw)
